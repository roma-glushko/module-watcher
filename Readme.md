# Module Watcher 🔎

Module Watcher makes sure that you won't miss any update from your third-party modules 
installed on the Magento2-based projects.

The project is on MVP stage and has a lot of var_dumps() 😄

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2
- Cron/CI system
- Git
- Sendmail/Slack

## Magento2 Modules

Module Watcher is capable to track the following types of third-party module installations:

- Third-party modules installed via Composer from Vendor Packagists
- Third-party modules installed via Composer from SI Packagists
- Third-party modules committed to the Codebase

## Workflow

### 1. Add a new project to the config file

Module Watcher has a common config files (possible to have a couple of them) 
that helps to declare and share watcher configurations. Example of the config file can be found
under `module-watcher.yaml.sample`.

### 2. Install your project

Module Watcher uses Git to access your project branch you want to track dependencies on.
Before watching you need to run `project:install-projects` command to make sure all projects and their configs are
installed and ready to be watched.

It's good to run this command after adding a new project, changing actual branch or changing list of branches.

### 3. Watch Your Modules

After your config file is installed, you are ready to run `project:watch` command and 
get notifications about module updates.

It's convenient to run the command from Cron or CLI to constantly get notifications and don't forget about this action.
